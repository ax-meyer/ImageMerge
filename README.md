# ImageMerge
Merges two images into one

This tool takes a list of images and merges them pairwise into one image.

For me, this came in handy because I wanted small images for a photo book, but the photo shop only offered sizes from 9x13cm² upwards. With this, I get 2 images on one picture and can cut them in half, yielding images with 4.5x6.5cm² dimension.
